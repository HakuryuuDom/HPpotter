# HPpotter  
A Tera-proxy module that automatically uses a *Prime Recovery Potable* when below 33% HP.  
Only uses items when you are alive and in combat.  
  
## Usage  
While in game, open /8 or /proxy:

**HPpotter** - Toggles between *"ENABLED"* and *"DISABLED"* state.

## Credits

**TeraProxy** for the source code from *Manapotter*. **Kitsu** just did a small fix to the int64 operations. 

>Thank you SaltyMonkey, Xiphion, Pinki, etc.
